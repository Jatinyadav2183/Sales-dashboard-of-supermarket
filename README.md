# Descibe of excel sheet

**The Excel file is organized into several sheets, each serving a distinct purpose in the dashboard creation process:**

1. **Input Data:** Likely contains the foundational raw data required for analysis.

2. **Analysis:** Summarized or processed data based on the raw data.

3. **Dashboard:** Visual representation of insights, including charts and other graphical elements.

4. **Master Data:** Reference or supporting data, often used for validation or lookups.

## Steps to Analyze and Document the Dashboard Creation Process

  The "Dashboard" sheet appears to contain graphical elements, such as charts, pivot tables, or slicers, designed to present key metrics and trends visually. Unlike other sheets, dashboards often rely heavily on Excel's UI tools and less on tabular data within the cells. Understanding the structure of this sheet will provide insights into the visual elements and metrics displayed.

  The "Input Data" sheet contains the detailed raw data upon which the dashboard relies. This sheet typically includes the following columns:

  **Date:** The transaction date for sales.
 
  **Product and Category Details:** Product ID, Product Name, Category, and Unit of Measure (UOM).
  
  **Transaction Details:** Quantity, Sale Type, Payment Mode, Discounts, Buying Price, and Selling Price.
  
  **Calculated Columns:** Total Buying Value and Total Selling Value.
  
  **Temporal Information:** Day, Month, and Year for time-based analysis.


  This raw data serves as the foundation for calculations and visualizations. Metrics such as total sales, profit, product or category performance, and sales trends can be derived from this dataset.

  The "Analysis" sheet transforms and summarizes the raw data to prepare it for visualization in the dashboard. This might include:

  Aggregated metrics (e.g., total sales, average discount, category-wise performance).
  
  Trend analyses (e.g., monthly sales growth, seasonal variations).
  
  Advanced calculations or derived fields that support the dashboard visuals.

  The "Master Data" sheet contains reference or supporting information, such as:

 Category hierarchies or product mappings.
 
 Validation lists for dropdowns or slicers.

 Additional metadata necessary for accurate analysis.
